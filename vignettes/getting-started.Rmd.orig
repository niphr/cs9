## What is CS9?

Core Surveillance 9 (CS9) is a comprehensive R framework designed for building real-time disease surveillance systems. It provides the infrastructure needed for:

- **Real-time data processing**: Automated pipelines for surveillance data
- **Database-driven workflows**: Robust data storage and retrieval
- **Task scheduling**: Parallel processing and workflow orchestration  
- **Epidemiological analysis**: Built-in support for surveillance concepts
- **Production deployment**: Docker-ready infrastructure for operational systems

CS9 is particularly suited for public health organizations, epidemiologists, and researchers who need to process surveillance data systematically and reliably.

## When Should You Use CS9?

CS9 is ideal when you need to:

- Process surveillance data on a regular schedule (daily, weekly)
- Maintain historical data with proper database management
- Run complex analysis pipelines with dependencies between tasks
- Deploy surveillance systems in production environments
- Handle multiple data sources and analysis outputs
- Ensure data validation and quality control

## Key Concepts

### Surveillance System Architecture

CS9 organizes surveillance work around these core concepts:

**Tasks**: The fundamental unit of work - things like "download weather data", "calculate disease trends", or "generate reports"

**Plans**: Data processing units within tasks - typically organized by time periods, geographic areas, or data subsets  

**Analyses**: Individual computations within plans - the actual analytical work performed on the data

**Schemas**: Database table definitions with validation rules and access control

### Example Workflow

A typical CS9 surveillance system might include:

1. **Data Import Task**: Download data from external APIs or files
2. **Data Cleaning Task**: Validate, standardize, and quality-check incoming data  
3. **Analysis Task**: Calculate surveillance indicators, trends, or alerts
4. **Reporting Task**: Generate outputs like Excel files, plots, or automated reports
5. **Delivery Task**: Send results via email, upload to websites, or trigger alerts

## Getting Started: The cs9example Template

The best way to start with CS9 is to use the [cs9example](https://github.com/csids/cs9example) repository as a template. This provides a complete, working surveillance system that you can customize.

### cs9example Structure

```{r echo=FALSE}
x <- csstyle::as_github_code("https://github.com/csids/cs9example/blob/main/R/00_env_and_namespace.R")
print(x, lines = 1:30, include_url = TRUE)
```

The cs9example demonstrates the standard file organization:

- **00_env_and_namespace.R**: Package setup and global environment
- **01_definitions.R**: Global definitions (borders, age groups, etc.)  
- **02_surveillance_systems.R**: Initialize the surveillance system
- **03_tables.R**: Database table definitions
- **04_tasks.R**: Task configurations
- **10_onLoad.R**: Package loading sequence

### Example Task Implementation

Here's how a surveillance task is structured in cs9example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
x <- csstyle::as_github_code("https://github.com/csids/cs9example/blob/main/R/04_tasks.R")
print(x, lines = 20:45, include_url = TRUE)
```

Each task includes:

- **Task configuration**: Name, parallelization, arguments
- **Data selector function**: Extracts data needed for the task
- **Action function**: Performs the actual analysis work
- **Database tables**: Input and output data storage

## Infrastructure Requirements

CS9 requires database infrastructure to function. After installing from CRAN, you'll need to:

1. **Set up a PostgreSQL database** (recommended) or MariaDB
2. **Configure environment variables** for database connection
3. **Use Docker for deployment** (recommended for production)

Without database setup, CS9 loads with limited functionality. You can check what's needed with:

```r
cs9::check_environment_setup()
```

## Next Steps

1. **Evaluate CS9**: Install from CRAN and explore the documentation
2. **Review cs9example**: Study the complete example implementation  
3. **Set up infrastructure**: Configure database and environment
4. **Clone cs9example**: Use it as a template for your surveillance system
5. **Customize**: Modify the example for your specific surveillance needs

For detailed infrastructure setup, see the [Installation](installation.html) vignette.
